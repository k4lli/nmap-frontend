please create a python application based on flask in its on virtual environment. 
the application needs to be able to be dockerised. please also follow api first strategy. anything the UI does, should be based on API queries to backend.
The idea for the app is a frontend for NMAP. It should have a modern cyber UI. I like green on black.

for this application the front end should have a top part where you can configure main nmap parameters.
It should have them pre-populated to my local network. make dropdowns or whatever suirs best for common scanner switches with explabnations
then a button that executes the command. it slould also have a logging window. maybe at the very bottom full width. 
the different windows should be resizable

the main part is the output of our application. once the scan is finished the application should interpret the network layout and show all connected devies. 
choose peoper icons for routers, media devices, try to interpret them based on their mac addresses. 

it should be a clean network graph.
